# hello-world
Hello! This is my first github project where I am: 
1) Creating and using a repository.
2) Starting and managing a new branch.
3) Making changes to a file and pushing them to GitHub as commits.
4) Opening and merging a pull request.

I feel like it is time for me to start working on my projects through github so here I am! 

I am an aspiring Javascript developer that has been working on building my portfolio 
using the FreeCodeCamp.com curriculum. What motivated me to start this journey?

I have been working as a Technical Support Engineer for the past 3 years and really miss working on new ideas and 
and feeling challenged through code. This has made me realize that I really enjoy building and improving code which 
is why I have decided to shift my career into becoming a developer. There is a lot more I would to write about, but 
hoping to start a blog soon to write about my current journey into web development.

Hope you have a great day!
